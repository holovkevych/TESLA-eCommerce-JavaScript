      "description": "The Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus is Tesla’s cheapest model as well as the quintessential affordable EV currently for sale. Whether it’s the Model 3 Standard Plus’s performance, range, or driving dynamics, it has been setting the industry basis for comparison since 2019. The Model 3 Standard Plus can go from zero to sixty in just 5.3 seconds, and its range is a solid EPA-rated 262 miles, which puts far costlier options to shame. If you want an entry-level Tesla, but are willing to wait until March 2022 for delivery, the Model 3 is an excellent option.",
