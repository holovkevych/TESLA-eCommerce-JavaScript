      "description": "While the refreshed Model S Plaid has captured most of the media’s attention, the refreshed Model S Long Range is excellent in its own respect. If you don’t think you need to accelerate to sixty in 1.99 seconds, want to save $40,000, and go a little further per charge, the Model S Long Range is the perfect premium sedan. With 405 miles of range and a 3.1 second zero to sixty run, it is likely more than what you’d need a luxury sedan to do.",
