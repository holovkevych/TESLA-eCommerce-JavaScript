      "description": "The Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus with the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery is the cloak-and-dagger Model 3. What makes the LFP Model 3 mysterious is the fact that it’s only available at dealerships or on Tesla’s inventory page. Moreover, unlike the regular Model 3 SR+, the LFP variant has 9 fewer miles of range, but it can be regularly charged to 100%. Effectively, you’d get more range on a daily basis because Tesla recommends charging to 90% on all other models. If you’re interested in a Model 3 and want one soon, the LFP is definitely the best way to go; just make sure to check with your local Tesla center to see if they’re in stock.",
