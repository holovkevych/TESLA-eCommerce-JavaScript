      "description": "After fulfilling deliveries in March 2020, the Model Y quickly dominated the electric crossover market. In early 2021, a less expensive Standard Range variant was released, but it only lasted for a few months. Now, the cheapest Model Y costs $53,990, but it can go 326 miles on a single charge and features a dual motor setup. While the price is becoming more and more out of reach, so is its delivery date. If you were to order a Long Range Y, youâ€™d be sitting at a March 2022 delivery date.",
