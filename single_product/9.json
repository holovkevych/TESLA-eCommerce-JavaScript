      "description": "The Model X Plaid is the surprising bargain on the list. While a six-figure SUV doesn’t typically resonate with a ‘bargain,’ rest assured that the Model X Plaid costs $10,000 less than the S Plaid. Both the S and X Plaid share the powertrain and technological underpinnings, but the X is a far more substantial vehicle. Furthermore, unlike the S, the X offers more storage, additional seating options, and a max tow rating of 5,000 pounds.",
