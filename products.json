The Model 3 Standard Plus can go from zero to sixty in just 5.3 seconds, and its range is a solid EPA-rated 262 miles, which puts far costlier options to shame. If you want an entry-level Tesla, but are willing to wait until March 2022 for delivery, the Model 3 is an excellent option.",

Effectively, you’d get more range on a daily basis because Tesla recommends charging to 90% on all other models.

However, the Roadster should be worth the wait because it will provide disturbingly quick performance numbers: 620 miles of range and a 1.9 second 0-60 run in the base model. A more powerful SpaceX Edition is also underway, and since it’s equipped with cold air thrusters, expect a zero to sixty time of around 1.1 seconds.",
